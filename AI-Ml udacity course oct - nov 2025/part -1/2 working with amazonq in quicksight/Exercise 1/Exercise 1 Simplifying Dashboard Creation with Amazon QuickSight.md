You've seen how Dashboards allow a data analyst to put critical business insights at the fingertips of business leaders. But it can be time consuming to figure out how to assemble QuickSight components to create those dashboards. If only there was a tool that could interpret plain-language descriptions of what we need, and build appropriate resources... wait - there is! Let’s see how we can use Amazon Q to make it easier to build Dashboards in Amazon QuickSight.
