You've developed a keen insight into your organization's data, seeing trends that could make or break the business if they aren't handled well. But how do you get those ideas in front of decisionmakers in a way that gives them that same insight, but in a fraction of the time? This calls for a Data Story - a narrative that combines persuasive text with the hard facts about the nature of the business to deliver an unmistakable message. Let’s see how Amazon Q in QuickSight can make a data analyst's job of creating these data stories easier.

1.  Open a QuickSight dashboard
2.  Choose Data Story from the Build menu at the top of the page
3.  Supply a prompt in the Build data story dialog box. “Build a data story about how roller skate sales are influenced by their customizability. Demonstrate that models of roller skates that have the greatest variety of colors, and the most options for personalization, are top sellers.”
4.  Choose Add Visuals, and add a dashboard and visuals for this story.
5.  Upload a document that contains the roller skate data to include in the story using the Select Documents area
6.  Choose Build
7.  Look over the data story, then choose Try Again
8.  Enter a new prompt: “Build a data story about how roller skate sales are influenced by country and skate customizability. Demonstrate that models of roller skates that have the greatest variety of colors, and the most options for personalization, are top sellers in key countries.”
9.  Add Visuals, and compare with the previous story.
10.  Select Keep, and show features to edit the data story.
