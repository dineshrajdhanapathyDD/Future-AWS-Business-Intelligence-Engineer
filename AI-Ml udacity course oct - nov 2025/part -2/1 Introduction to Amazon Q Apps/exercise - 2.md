## Objective

In this exercise, you will learn how to identify and evaluate everyday business or operational tasks that are good candidates for automation using generative AI tools like Amazon Q Business.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

-   A basic understanding of generative AI capabilities (e.g., text generation, summarization, classification, code generation, image generation)
-   Familiarity with your organization’s workflows or access to sample business processes (e.g., customer support tickets, internal documentation, onboarding processes)

## Instructions

#### Step 1: Select a Use Case Domain

Choose a specific domain or business area to focus on (e.g., HR, Customer Support, Sales, Finance, or IT Operations).

#### Step 2: List Current Tasks

Make a list of repetitive or time-consuming tasks within that domain. Examples include:

-   Generating Monthly Product Performance Summaries
-   Responding to Customer FAQs from Product Documentation
-   Drafting Employee Performance Reviews
-   Preparing Custom Legal Contracts
-   Designing New Brand Identity for Product Launch
-   Investigating Compliance Violations

#### Step 3: Evaluate Each Task for Automation Potential

For each task, evaluate whether generative AI could help by answering the following:

-   **Is it repetitive or rule-based?**
-   **Does it involve generating or processing natural language or structured data?**
-   **What risks or limitations might come with automating that task?**
-   **Would there be any human judgement required for the task?**

For evaluation, use the provided Excel sheet, which you can download from the "Downloads" section. This sheet contains a list of the tasks and a framework/method to help you decide.

#### Step 4: Prioritize High-Impact Opportunities

From your evaluation, select the top 2–3 tasks that are:

-   High volume
-   Easy to automate
-   Low risk if automated
-   Likely to deliver measurable time/cost savings

## Tip:

Start small. Begin automating low-risk, low-effort tasks first to build confidence and demonstrate value. You can then expand to more complex scenarios as you learn what works.
